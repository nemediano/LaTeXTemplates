  Abstract                 = {Spinning tops and yo-yos have long fascinated cultures around the world with their unexpected, graceful motions that seemingly elude gravity. We present an algorithm to generate designs for spinning objects by optimizing rotational dynamics properties. As input, the user provides a solid 3D model and a desired axis of rotation. Our approach then modifies the mass distribution such that the princi- pal directions of the moment of inertia align with the target rotation frame. We augment the model by creating voids inside its volume, with interior fill represented by an adaptive multi-resolution vox- elization. The discrete voxel fill values are optimized using a con- tinuous, nonlinear formulation. Further, we optimize for rotational stability by maximizing the dominant principal moment. We extend our technique to incorporate deformation and multiple materials for cases where internal voids alone are insufficient. Our method is well-suited for a variety of 3D printed models, ranging from char- acters to abstract shapes. We demonstrate tops and yo-yos that spin surprisingly stably despite their asymmetric appearance. CR},

We gather and analyze data from a number of artists as they sketch a human face from a reference photograph. To achieve different levels of abstraction in the sketches, decreasing time limits were imposed -- from four and a half minutes to fifteen seconds. We analyzed the data at two levels: strokes and geometric shape. In each, we create a model that captures both the style of the different artists and the process of abstraction. These models are then used for a portrait sketch synthesis application. Starting from a novel face photograph, we can synthesize a sketch in the various artistic styles and in different levels of abstraction.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing techniques for support generation fall into two categories: The first allow for very reliable prints by enclosing the bottom of the object in a dense structure, at the expense of increased material usage and build times. The second generate thin hierarchical struc- tures connecting to the surface in a sparse number of points. This uses less material, at the expense of reliability: the part might be- come unstable, the structure itself may become difficult to print, the bottom surface quality degrades. The user therefore has to correct the structure and its parameters for each new object. We propose to exploit the ability of FFF printers to print bridges across gaps. Since bridges are always supported by pillars at their extremities, they are both stronger and more stable than hierarchical tree structures. Our technique first selects the points to support based on overhang and part stability during the entire print process. It then optimizes for a printable scaffolding composed of bridges and vertical pillars, supporting all points. The result is an automated support generation technique using little material while ensuring fine surface quality and stability during the printing process.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, we have seen a growing trend in the design and fabrication of personalized figurines, created by scanning real people and then physically reproducing miniature statues with 3D printers. This is currently a hot topic both in academia and industry, and the printed figurines are gaining more and more realism, especially with state-of-the-art facial scanning technology improving. However, current systems all contain the same limitation - no previous method is able to suitably capture personalized hair-styles for physical reproduction. Typically, the subject's hair is approximated very coarsely or replaced completely with a template model. In this paper we present the first method for stylized hair capture, a technique to reconstruct an individual's actual hair-style in a manner suitable for physical reproduction. Inspired by centuries-old artistic sculptures, our method generates hair as a closed-manifold surface, yet contains the structural and color elements stylized in a way that captures the defining characteristics of the hair-style. The key to our approach is a novel multi-view stylization algorithm, which extends feature-preserving color filtering from 2D images to irregular manifolds in 3D, and introduces abstract geometric details that are coherent with the color stylization. The proposed technique fits naturally in traditional pipelines for figurine reproduction, and we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our approach by capturing several subjects with widely varying hair-styles.},

  Abstract                 = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a â€œpositive feedback loopâ€? effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the â€œprint-it-allâ€? paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce an algorithm and representation for fabricating 3D shape abstractions using mutually intersecting planar cut-outs. The planes have prefabricated slits at their intersections and are assembled by sliding them together. Often such abstractions are used as a sculptural art form or in architecture and are colloquially called ‘cardboard sculptures'. Based on an analysis of construction rules, we propose an extended binary space partitioning tree as an efficient representation of such cardboard models which allows us to quickly evaluate the feasibility of newly added planar elements. The complexity of insertion order quickly increases with the number of planar elements and manual analysis becomes intractable. We provide tools for generating cardboard sculptures with guaranteed constructibility. In combination with a simple optimization and sampling strategy for new elements, planar shape abstraction models can be designed by iteratively adding elements. As an output, we obtain a fabrication plan that can be printed or sent to a laser cutter. We demonstrate the complete process by designing and fabricating cardboard models of various well-known 3D shapes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The orientation of a model is computed indirectly by surface of the volumetric mesh. In this paper, we extend our indirect computation to an approach that the computation is directly based on the information of input models by an algorithm using incremental linear programming and K-means clustering. The performance of this approach is decoupled from the shape similarity between the volumetric mesh and the input model. As a result, representations obtained from simpler volumetric decomposition such as voxels can be adopted as the domain of computation.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical modeling is a novel theory for 3D print- ing; this approach involves the use of a single material to control physical properties, such as center of mass, totalmass, and moment of inertia. In this work, we present a density- variable shape modeling method to meet the required strength of 3D objects. We estimate a continuous density distribution that satisfies the detected local stress distribution of3Dobjects based on cross-sectional stress analysis.We then utilize a pure mathematical 3D implicit function to generate a porous struc- ture with a gradational interior to represent this density distri- bution.With our method, 3Dobjects with desired sound struc- tures can be fabricated with low material consumption. In addition, the whole design process can be completed easily and interactively. Keywords},

In this paper, we present a method to reduce the material cost and weight of a given object while providing a durable printed model that is resistant to impact and external forces. We introduce a hollowing optimization algorithm based on the concept of honeycomb-cells structure. Honeycombs structures are known to be of minimal material cost while providing strength in tension. We utilize the Voronoi diagram to compute irregular honeycomb-like volume tessellations which define the inner struc- ture. We formulate our problem as a strengthâ€“toâ€“weight optimiza- tion and cast it as mutually finding an optimal interior tessellation and its maximal hollowing subject to relieve the interior stress. Thus, our system allows to build-to-last 3D printed objects with large control over their strength-to-weight ratio and easily model various interior structures. We demonstrate our method on a col- lection of 3D objects from different categories. Furthermore, we evaluate our method by printing our hollowed models and measure their stress and weights.},

While such objects can be very detailed, capturing every small feature, they are often identified and characterized by a small set of defining curves. Compact, abstracted shape descriptions based on such curves are often visually more appealing than the original models, which can appear to be visually cluttered. We introduce a novel algorithm for abstracting three-dimensional geometric models using characteristic curves or contours as building blocks for the abstraction. Our method robustly handles models with poor connectivity, including the extreme cases of polygon soups, common in models of man-made objects taken from online repositories. In our algorithm, we use a two-step procedure that first approximates the input model using a manifold, closed envelope surface and then extracts from it a hierarchical abstraction curve network along with suitable normal information. The constructed curve networks form a compact, yet powerful, representation for the input shapes, retaining their key shape characteristics while discarding minor details and irregularities.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in 3D printing technologies bring wide range of applications from fast prototyping to product manufacturing. However, one intrinsic limitation of 3D printing is that we cannot fabricate a single object that is larger than the working volume of a 3D printer. To address this issue, we may partition the given object into 3D parts of manageable sizes for printing, and then assemble the object from the printed 3D parts. Rather than using connectors, glue, or skew, we propose to connect the printed 3D parts by 3D interlocking such that the assembled object can be not only repeatedly disassembled and reassembled, but also strongly connected by the parts' own geometry. To achieve these, we develop a voxelization-based approach to partition a given 3D model into 3D interlocking parts. To guarantee the generated 3D parts to be structurally sound and well-connected by 3D interlocking, we deform the local geometry of the 3D model to avoid voxel fragmentation, employ internal voxels to create initial interlocking parts, and analyze the local shape within voxels to guide the final parts construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 3D models with a variety of shapes, and realize some of them by 3D printing.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Nowadays, 3D mesh animations have been increasingly used in various applications, e.g., in digital entertainment and physically based simulation. In many applications, it is possible that a surface animation undergoes some lossy operations which can impair its perceptual quality. Since the end users of mesh animations are often human beings, the perceptual quality assessment of 3D dynamic meshes has recently emerged as an interesting and important research problem. In this paper, we will first of all present the results of a large-scale subjective experimental study carried out to collect human opinion scores of the perceptual quality of distorted dynamic meshes. We integrate in our subjective study a large set of 276 impaired mesh sequences with different distortion intensities and categories, such as spatial and temporal visual masking simulation, lossy compression and network transmission error. The constructed database is publicly available and can serve as ground-truth data for the performance evaluation of objective metrics of dynamic mesh perceptual quality. A comparative study is then conducted to benchmark existing objective metrics. The main finding of this objective study is that in general model-based quality metrics outperform image- and video-based quality metrics, but none of the existing metrics can achieve high correlation with human opinion scores on the whole subjective database and for all kinds of distortions. Finally, a simple but effective full-reference objective metric is proposed for the perceptual quality assessment of 3D dynamic meshes, which incorporates both spatial and temporal features and which provides a satisfactory correlation value when tested on the subjective database. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Reliable estimation of visual saliency is helpful to guide many computer graphics tasks including shape matching, simplification, segmentation, etc. Inspired by basic principles induced by psychophysics studies, we propose a novel approach for computing saliency for 3D mesh surface considering both local contrast and global rarity. First, a multi-scale local shape descriptor is introduced to capture local geometric features with various regions, which is rotationally invariant. Then, we present an efficient patch-based local contrast method based on the multi-scale local descriptor. The global rarity is defined by its specialty to all other vertices. To be more efficient, we compute it on clusters first and interpolate on vertices later. Finally, our mesh saliency is obtained by the linear combination of the local contrast and the global rarity. Our method is efficient, robust, and yields mesh saliency that agrees with human perception. The algorithm is tested on many models and outperformed previous works. We also demonstrated the benefits of our algorithm in some geometry processing applications. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a co-abstraction method that takes as input a collection of 3D objects, and produces a mutually consistent and individually identity-preserving abstraction of each object. In general, an abstraction is a simpler version of a shape that preserves its main characteristics. We hypothesize, however, that there is no single abstraction of an object. Instead, there is a variety of possible abstractions, and an admissible one can only be chosen conjointly with other objects' abstractions. To this end, we introduce a new approach that hierarchically generates a spectrum of abstractions for each model in a shape collection. Given the spectra, we compute the appropriate abstraction level for each model such that shape simplification and inter-set consistency are collectively maximized, while individual shape identities are preserved.

  Abstract                 = {Direct digital manufacturing is a set of rapidly evolving technologies that provide easy ways to manufacture highly customized and unique products. The development pipeline for such products is radically different from the conventional manufacturing pipeline: 3D geometric models are designed by users often with little or no manufacturing experience, and sent directly to the printer. Structural analysis on the user side with conventional tools is often unfeasible as it requires specialized training and software. Trial-and-error, the most common approach, is time-consuming and expensive. We present a method that would identify structural problems in objects designed for 3D printing based on geometry and material properties only, without specific assumptions on loads and manual load setup. We solve a constrained optimization problem to determine the "worst" load distribution for a shape that will cause high local stress or large deformations. While in its general form this optimization has a prohibitively high computational cost, we demonstrate that an approximate method makes it possible to solve the problem rapidly for a broad range of printed models. We validate our method both computationally and experimentally and demonstrate that it has good predictive power for a number of diverse 3D printed shapes.},
