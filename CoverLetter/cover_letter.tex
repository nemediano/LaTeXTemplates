%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


%The first paragraph should contain a self-introduction. You should write who you are, where your expertise lies, where you found the job posting, and why you want to apply for the job.
I am a graduate student with a strong background in mathematics and currently focused in computer science. I found out about the Parallel Computing Internship at NVIDIA from linkedin, since I did two internships at Nvidia during the last years I have some contacts in the company. Since I expect to graduate in spring of 2017, I am interested in another internship position in order to gain more experience and continue a career path in at Nvidia which I believe is an excellent place to work.

%The second paragraph should respond directly to the job description written by the hiring manager. Describe how your previous job experiences, skills, and abilities will allow you to meet the company’s needs. To make that easier, you can (and should) literally include words and phrases from the job description in your cover letter.
%As a student in Computer Science I am a proficient programmer, especially in C++, C\# and Java, and because my focus has been in computer graphics I have experience using OpenGL and Qt. Even though most of my experience is in desktop applications, I have excellent web developing skills. During the last academic year I was a teaching assistant in two web development classes at the Computer Graphics department at Purdue. One of this classes was focused in front end technologies using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and the second was focused in back end development using ASP.NET MVC. I am also familiar with PHP programming and frameworks like Joomla and Wordpress.
As a student in Computer Science I am a proficient programmer, especially in C++, C\# and Java, and because my focus has been in computer graphics I have experience using OpenGL and Qt. Even though I have been focus in software developing during the last years, I have an excellent background in mathematics. I did my bachelors in Applied Mathematics, and have been always worked on research and academic positions in scientific computation.

%To go the extra mile, do some research about the company, and try to find out what they are doing — and why — given the current state of their industry. Explain how you can fit into that schema, and help push the company forward and achieve any goals you suspect they may have.
During my Ph.D. I took several Image processing classes. One of this classes focused on analysis of satellite imagery. That was my first encounter with GIS applications. I believe GIS to be an exciting field for professional development. During my Ph.D. I have specially focused in procedural modeling techniques. From there, I used City Engine for a research project about analysis of road networks using graph theory.

%The final paragraph is called the “call to action” portion of your cover letter. Inform them that you’d love to get interviewed. Give them your contact information. Tell them that you’ll be in contact with them in a week if you don’t hear back. Thank them for spending the time to read your cover letter.
I would love to have an interview with any software development team at ESRI. My preferred contact method is email at garci191@purdue.edu. Thank you very much for your consideration. I am eagerly looking forward for your response.
