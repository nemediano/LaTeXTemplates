# LaTeXTemplates
Hold some useful latex templates that I have been gather
through my stdent life.
These templates should work on any GNU/Linux install using
texlive, or in any win machine using Miktex.
My editors of choise are Kile in GNU/Linux and TeXniCenter
on win, so I will try to include project files for both.
