# LaTeXTemplates
Hold some useful latex templates that I have made through my student life.
These templates should work on any GNU/Linux install using texlive, or in any windows machine using MiKTex.
My editors of choose are Kile in GNU/Linux and TeXniCenter on windows, so I will try to include project files for both.
The homework template is updated to use XeLaTex, Biber and mint. So, it requires some extra install
